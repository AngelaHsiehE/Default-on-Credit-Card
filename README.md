# Default on Credit Card

## Business Problem
This project is to solve the problem of increase in customer default rates, which causes revenue and customer loss for credit card companies. The loss can be limited if credit card companies can pre-qualify customers of low risk and avoid those that are likely to default on payment. In this project, we'll identify the target groups with low and high risk of defaulting on credit card, as well as minimize the loss for credit card companies by minimizing the number of false negatives in our prediction.     

## Exploarion Of The Data
In this section, we'll investigate the relationship between customers' demographic variables, payment history, bill amount, payment amount, and their chances of defaulting on payment. Therefore, we can identify the features that are likely to be good predictors. Finally, we'll use feature engineering techniques to normalize the numerical features.
