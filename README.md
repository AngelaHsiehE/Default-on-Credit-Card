# Default on Credit Card

This project is to solve the problem of increase in customer default rates, which causes revenue and customer loss for credit card companies. The loss can be limited if credit card companies can pre-qualify customers of low risk and avoid those that are likely to default on payment. In this project, we'll identify the target groups with low and high risk of defaulting on credit card, as well as minimize the loss for credit card companies by minimizing the number of false negatives in our prediction.
